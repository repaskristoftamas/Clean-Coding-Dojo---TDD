## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to develop a simple application using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** during the **Clean Coding Dojo** event (check About section for the article URL on **Medium.com**).

To achieve this within a relatively short time, the focus was on keeping things as simple as possible. You won't find any fancy unit testing frameworks or exotic technologies here â€” just plain and simple **C#** and  **MSTest**.

This repository was private since July 2021, but now I've decided to make it public and refactor the codebase a little bit.
